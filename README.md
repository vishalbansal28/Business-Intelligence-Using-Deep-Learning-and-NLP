# Design of Business Intelligence on Geospatial Data Using Deep Learning
## Overview
This project focuses on leveraging geospatial data and deep learning algo, and on the design and implementation of a business intelligence system using geospatial data. The goal is to develop a comprehensive framework that leverages geospatial information to identify and assess potential business opportunities in specific regions or areas of interest.

## Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models
- Scikit-learn for machine learning utilities
- Deep Learning Techniques: CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, LDA, LSA
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
- Data Processing Tools: Tokenizer
- Data Sources: Yelp Open Dataset
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Confusion Matrix, Coherence Score
- Geospatial Analysis Tools
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Tools: textblob
- Web development frameworks (Streamlit)

## Key Features
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Deep Learning Model Implementation
3. Performance Evaluation
4. Business Opportunity Analysis
5. Decision Support System
6. Contribution to Economic Growth
